data-cleaning-project
=====================

I am cleaning data for the class Getting and Cleaning Data offered by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.org

I download data taken during various activities by UC-Irvine researchers and manipulate it with the run_anaysis.R script, extracting a "clean" dataset that summarizes the mean value of feature variables for each combination of subject and exercise.

The Codebook explains my decisions to name variables as I did.
